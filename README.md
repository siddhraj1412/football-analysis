# Football Analysis

## Overview

This project provides tools and example notebooks for analyzing football match data using Python and Jupyter Notebook. The goal is to make it easy to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualize football statistics, and build custom workflows for football (soccer) analytics.

## Features

- Fast data loading and cleaning with Pandas and NumPy
- Exploratory Data Analysis of players, matches, and clubs
- Visualizations of football metrics using Matplotlib and Seaborn
- Example workflows for feature engineering and reporting
- Easily extendable structure for your own football datasets

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn

### Installation

1. **Clone this repository**
```
git clone https://github.com/siddhraj1412/football-analysis.git
cd football-analysis
```
3. **Install dependencies**
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. **Start Jupyter (if using notebooks)**
jupyter notebook

## Usage

1. Open a notebook in the `notebooks/` directory.
2. Point data loading cells to the files in your `data/` folder.
3. Execute the cells step-by-step to perform analyses and view visualizations.
4. Use and adapt the provided examples for your own football-related projects.

## Example Analyses

- Calculate leading goal-scorers per club or per season
- Visualize age or nationality distribution of players
- Breakdown of goals and assists by position
- Compare team performances based on various metrics
- Feature engineering for predictive modeling
